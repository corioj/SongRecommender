# SongRecommender
Implementing a basic content-based filtering recommender system for songs on Spotify from Kaggle dataset

Basic data analysis and visualization, before briefly examining clustering and then creating the recommender syster in a Python class. 

Nothing crazy, just something I did to get a feel for it something new.
